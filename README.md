# proximity-labeling-proteomics
A proximity labeling experiment to identify interaction partners of protein Argonaute-2 in mediating RNA silencing processes

## Motivation
Proximity labeling is a powerful tool for revealing potential protein interaction partners. Its application
has helped to expand our understanding of the molecular functions of cellular proteins, a central quest
in molecular cell biology. The goal of this study is to show that biotin-labeling proteins, an engineered
ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) and biotin ligase (BirA), can be employed to track both protein and RNA
interactors of an RNA-binding protein. Argonaute 2 (AGO2) is a well-studied example of such protein
that plays a critical role in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. By harnessing the high-throughput capability
of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics for protein characterization, we hope to both confirm known and
uncover novel AGO2 proximity partners.
